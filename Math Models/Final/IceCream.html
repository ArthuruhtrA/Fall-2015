        Cream Ordered Puzzle</span></h2>
    <p> Four girls, Bridget, Glenda, Patricia and Viola, go to the ice cream
      store to order a cone with one scoop of ice cream. Each girl has a unique
      favorite flavor: Cherry, Coconut, Peppermint or Vanilla. On entering the
      store, the girls line up to place their orders.</p>
    <p>Below are some facts applicable to the problem, use these and the
      constraint that no two distinct girls have the same favorite flavor, to
      determine which flavor each girl ordered and where each girl was in line.
      NOTE: In the Alloy model the girls are ordered from first to last, where
      the first girl is the first one to place an order.</p>
